# DMLabNorthWest
A repository for development of my various Drake Music Lab North West projects.

For the Swan Street Collective project:

a) a gesturally controlled ‘air-harp’ - developed in openFrameworks and using a Leap Motion controller - in the 'Leap_Midi_DatGui_working' folder;

b) a vocal to MIDI interface - using a Teensy 3.6, Audio Adaptor Board, Audio Library and cheap mic head-set;

c) and a hand-held, wireless, distance sensor based device - integrating an Adafruit Huzzah, a Pololu VL6180X Time-of-Flight distance sensor, a Pimoroni Haptic Buzzz DRV2605L linear actuator haptic breakout, an Adafruit LIS3DH triple-axis accelerometer, a NeoPixel 24 LED ring, a 1000mAh LiPo battery and an Adafruit Powerboost 1000C charger module + other passive components.
