# DMLabNorthWest
A repository for development of my various Drake Music Lab North West projects.

For the Swan Street Collective project:

a) a a gesturally controlled MIDI harp - developed in openFrameworks and using a Leap Motion controller - in the 'oF' > 'Leap_Midi_DatGui_working' folder;

b) a voice to MIDI convertor - using a Teensy 3.6, Audio Adaptor Board, Audio Library and cheap mic head-set - in the 'Arduino' > 'MicIn_USBMIDI_RAR_SM' folder;

c) and a hand-held, wireless MIDI, distance sensor instrument â€“ integrating an Adafruit Huzzah ESP8266 breakout, a Pololu VL6180X Time-of-Flight distance sensor, a Pimoroni Haptic BZZZ DRV2605L linear actuator haptic breakout, an Adafruit LIS3DH triple-axis accelerometer, a NeoPixel 24 x LED ring, a 1000mAh LiPo battery and an Adafruit Powerboost 1000C charger module + other passive components - in the 'oF' > 'SSC_Huzzah_MIDI_control' and 'Arduino' > 'rtpmidi_esp8266_vl6180x_statemachine_fastled_working' folders.
